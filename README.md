First Profile Project Using HTML & CSS

I’ve just completed my first project using HTML and CSS. It’s a one-page website that gathers all my social media accounts in one place, making it easy for anyone to contact me for work opportunities.

A modern one-page personal profile built using HTML and CSS. This page acts as a digital business card, helping people reach out for work, projects, or collaborations.

🚀 Features

✅ Responsive Design – Looks great on desktop, tablet, and mobile

✅ Profile Section – Includes photo, name, location, and a short bio

✅ Social Media Links – GitHub, Instagram, Gmail, Twitter, LinkedIn

✅ Interactive Buttons – Hover effects for better user experience

✅ Custom Fonts & Colors – Modern aesthetic with CSS variables
